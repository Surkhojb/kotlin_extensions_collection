# kotlin_extensions_collection
**Collection of extensions created for different purposes** 

I've been working into different projects at work or just personal ones, during this time I created different kotlin extensions function. But when I wanted to use one of these extensions functions I ended up creating a new one beceause I couldn't remember in what project I used it or I didn't have access to the project in that momment. So because of that I thought to create a new repository to save all this extensions and have access to them easily. 

I will try to structure those functions depending if they are extensions for a view, activity or another component. And also I will try to keep the repository up to date.
